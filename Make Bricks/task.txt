We want to make a row of bricks that is `goal` inches long.
We have a number of small bricks each of which is 1(one) inch long and big bricks
each of which is 5(five) inches long. Write a function to
return `true` if it is possible to make the `goal`
by choosing from the given bricks and `false` if it is not.
This is a little harder than it looks and can be done without any loops.

The first parameter for the function is the number of small bricks
The second parameter for the function is the number of big bricks
The third parameter is the goal(the length of brick combination we are trying to form)

makeBricks(3, 1, 8) → true
makeBricks(3, 1, 9) → false
makeBricks(3, 2, 10) → true
